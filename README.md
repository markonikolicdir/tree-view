 # Developer Code Test
For all new Full-Stack Developers being evaluated to join Jaggaer Direct development. The point is to get a quick look at general code style/habits/problem solving abilities. The task is not difficult on purpose so it can be implemented without investing too much time.

## 1.0 Introduction

The target of this is to implement a collapsible multilevel TreeView - It should look something like this: 

![Tree View](GenericTreeView.jpg)  
However check section 5 for more Infos on that. 

- The Data is provided in the [db.sql](db.sql) file and should be imported into your local MySQL Database
- The DB Structure is not optimal on purpose and should not be changed
- Implement your code the best you can (optimized/commented/fast etc.)
- In case you have suggestions on how to better structure the database please add these to the solution email

Note: In the following text "node" and "entry" are used as synonyms.

### 1.1. How to Submit your Result

1. Put your solution in an archive (e.g. ZIP, TAR) and name the archive file lastname_firstname_dev_test.zip
2. Upload your solution to the private cloud storage of your choice (e.g. Google Drive, Dropbox)
3. Share this file with us through a link you create in your cloud storage
4. Send us an e-mail:
  * Subject: Test Result firstname lastname
  * To: the person who sent you the original mail and
  * Cc: akulikov@jaggaer.com, cherndler@jaggaer.com  
  * Body:
    * the link where we can download your solution
    * any additional information you like to pass to us (e.g. why you solved things in a certain way, etc.)

### 1.2 Questions:

If you have any questions feel free to drop me a mail with "Code Test Question" in the subject to [cherndler@jaggaer.com](cherndler@jaggaer.com)

## 2.0 DB Structure

*tree_entry* 
* features a list of all the nodes
* if parent_entry_id==0 the node is on the root level, if its anything but 0 the node is under the referred parent entry id.
* entry_ids are not in the order they will appear in the tree and entry_id 16 is missing on purpose

*tree_entry_lang*
* translation table for the names of the tree nodes
* not all entries exist in both languages - this was done on purpose.

## 3.0 ToDo / Code

1. Create a new mysql database and import the tables and data provided in db.sql
2. Implement the methods from the abstract class in the file/class [myTreeView.class.php](myTreeView.class.php)
3. We want 2 versions of the TreeView :
	A. one that preloads all nodes of the tree when loading the site and only shows/hides the nodes by javascript when collapsing/expanding (so no Ajax)
	B. one that only load/shows the parent_entry_id=0 nodes at first and loads the nodes under it by ajax once the user expands a given node.

A. shall be implemented in showCompleteTree
B. shall be implemented in showAjaxTree
	* The php ajax callback should be implemented in fetchAjaxTreeNode which should receive the entry_id of the node the user clicked on.

4. Implement a button to switch between ajax and the completeTree mode
5. index.php may be altered any way you want. The abstractTreeView.class.php must be used and untouched tho.

Note: Images for the treeview are provided in the images folder

### 3.1 Required Features:

1. The tree must start out completely collapsed
2. German (ger) translations must be shown, in case a translation doesn't exist show the english one as fallback
3. Expanding/Collapsing nodes of the tree should be done by Javascript -> no page reload
4. Be as efficient as possible - fancy solutions are favored
5. Tree should be sorted/shown with entries in alphabetical order

## 4. Rules

1. No copy+pasting of complete implementations from the internet.
2. Using Google/Internet is of course allowed tho
3. You may use a JS helper library such as jquery/prototype - but not an already completely done TreeView widget/function/implementation
4. You may use a database abstraction layer such as adodb http://adodb.sourceforge.net/
5. Using a template engine such as smarty is not required, you can use it if you want tho
6. You can optimize things like Unique/Keys/Indexes in the database, but not alter the fields or content of the data.
7. You can create as much files/folders as you want
8. Obviously you are free to create/add as many sub-methods in your class as you want
9. Must run on PHP 7.2
10. Completing the assignment in Symfony 4 and/or React is a plus
11. Error level must not be changed or hidden and no notices/warnings/errors should be produced by your code
12. Do not upload the code test and/or your solution to a public repository

## 5. Expected Result:

Tree should start out looking like this:

```
+ Prio 1 Aufgaben
+ Prio 2 Aufgaben
+ Prio 3 Aufgaben
```

by clicking on the + icon next to the level the + icon turns into a minus and the entries below it show up, i.e. for Prio 1 Tasks:

```
- Prio 1 Aufgaben
	+ Supplier
	+ Customer
+ Prio 2 Aufgaben
+ Prio 3 Aufgaben
```

then, of course by clicking on the + next to the Supplier entry reveals the nodes under it

```
- Prio 1 Aufgaben
	+ Supplier
		  Punkt ABC123
		+ Punkt BCD123
		  Punkt UARGH123
	+ Customer
+ Prio 2 Aufgaben
+ Prio 3 Aufgaben
```

and so on. Note how ABC123 and UARGH123 have no more nodes under it therefore no +/- icon (use the blank.gif in the images folder in this case)
